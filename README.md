# Simple Go AES

We built a simple golang library to encrypt and decrypt AES with strings or byte arrays, so we thought we'd share.

The library can work with byte arrays or strings, depending on your preference.

We prefer strings because they are more interoperable with our database objects.

Please feel free to update and improve.
